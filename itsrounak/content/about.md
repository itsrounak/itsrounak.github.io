# About Me
 Hi there! 👋

My name is Rounak! I am currently a full-time undergraduate student at Monash University (Australia), majoring in Computer Science 👨‍💻. My current study focuses on Data Science and Business Analytics.

I enjoy doing math and often practice problem solving skills with Kaggle (keen to expand to other sites like Datakind in the near future!) Throughout my undergraduate studies, I assisted mentoring freshman students in kickstarting their data science journey.

You can easily get in touch with me with email.
